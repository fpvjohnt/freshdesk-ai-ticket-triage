FreshDesk AI Ticket Triage (FATT)
FATT is an AI-powered system designed to automate and optimize the ticket triage process for FreshDesk users. By leveraging machine learning techniques, FATT analyzes incoming support tickets, predicts appropriate tags, and assists support teams in prioritizing and routing tickets more efficiently.
Project Overview
FATT aims to:

Automatically fetch new tickets from FreshDesk
Preprocess and analyze ticket content
Extract relevant features for machine learning
Train a model to predict appropriate tags for tickets
Apply predicted tags to new tickets
Update tickets in FreshDesk with AI-suggested tags

Current Progress

 Project structure set up
 Basic data preprocessing pipeline implemented
 Feature extraction module created
 Initial model training script developed
 Prediction module implemented
 Main script created to orchestrate the workflow
 FreshDesk API integration (in progress)
 Model performance evaluation and optimization
 User interface for manual review of AI suggestions
 Deployment and scheduling of automated runs

Next Steps

Complete FreshDesk API integration for ticket fetching and updating
Implement comprehensive error handling and logging
Develop a dashboard for monitoring model performance
Create a user interface for reviewing and adjusting AI-suggested tags
Set up automated testing for all components
Optimize model performance and explore advanced NLP techniques
